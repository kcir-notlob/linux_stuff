This is a simple how to for cgroups
cgroups allow resources to be controlled

cgroups has been in the kernel for some time
and originally created by Google
Is currently used along with namespaces to
implement containers.


By default the /Sys/fs/cgroup/ shoulds be mounted already
entries can be created manually but would recommend 
using the helpers

dnf install libcgroup libcgroup-tools



For persistent entries use the service
systemctl restart  cgconfig

The configuration file for this is located at:
/etc/cgconfig.conf


Helpers

cgcreate #creates a cgroup
example cgcreate -g memory:bds

Will create a group at 
/sys/fs/cgroup/memory/bds

cgclassify #allows one or more running process to be put in a group
example cgclassify -g memory:bds 1234 5678

All this does is put the pids in the tasks file under the controller
cgexec # starts a process in a cgroup
example cgexec -g memory:bds ~/test.sh

cgdelete #removes a cgroup
example cgdelete memory:bds


cgget #reads a property from a cgroup
cgset #reads and write a property in a cgroup


cgsnapshot #gets a snapshot that is compatible with cgconfig
can extract bits of the file to create or add to  a config file



What cgroup is a process in
cat /proc/self/cgroup

List the sub systems
lssubsys 



Example config file for persistent entries

group bds {
        perm {
                admin {
                        uid = test;
                        gid = test;
                }
                task {
                        uid = test;
                        gid = test;
                }
        }
        memory {
                memory.limit_in_bytes="104857600";
                memory.memsw.limit_in_bytes="104857600";
        }
}


Note the tasks file in the controller will be owned by task (test:test)
the other entries will be owned by admin (test:test)



Example running a bad application

cgexec --sticky -g memory:bds bdsImportGui

When opening a bad datafile this application would take down the system
writing to swap. But when run in the group the kernel will terminate the application
with Killed reported
